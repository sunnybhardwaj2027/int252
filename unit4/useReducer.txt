What is useReducer in React?
=> 'useReducer' is a react hook used to manage complex state logic.
=> it is an alternative to useState

Think of it like :-
. useState: You change state Directly.
. useReducer: You describe HOW state should change using a 'reducer' function.

=> it works just like Redux but inside a component.

Syntax: 
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

Meaning:

state => current state value
dispatch => function to send an action
reducer => function describing how the state updates
initialState => starting value

Reducer Function:-

function reducer(state, action){
    switch(action.type){
        case "Increment": 
            return {count: state.count + 1};
        
        case "Decrement":
            return {count: state.count -1};

        default: 
            return state;
    }
}

=> a reducer must always return new State, never mutate

complete working example ---

counter with useReducer
CounterWithuseReducer.jsx

import React from 'react'
import { useReducer } from 'react'

const initialState = { count : 0 };

function reducer(state, action){
    switch(action.type) {
        case "Increment":
            return { count: state.count + 1};
        
        case "Decrement":
            return { count: state.count -1};

        case "Reset":
            return initialState;

        default: 
            return state;
    }
}

const CounterWithuseReducer = () => {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer , initialState);


  return (
    <>
        <h1>{state.count}</h1>
        <button style={{padding:"20px" ,margin:"20px"}} onClick={() => dispatch({ type : "Increment"})}>+</button>
        <button style={{padding:"20px" ,margin:"20px"}} onClick={() => dispatch({ type : "Decrement"})}>-</button>
        <button style={{padding:"20px" ,margin:"20px"}} onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "Reset"})}>Reset</button>
    </>
  )
}

export default CounterWithuseReducer

ACTION => object that tells what to do.

dispatch({ 
    type : "Increment",
    payload : 5 => payload is for extra data.
})

Example:- 
case "add":
    return { count : state.count + action.payload };

WHEN TO USE useReducer INSTEAD OF useState;

simple state => useState
Multiple state values => useState
Many updates depends upon previous state => useReducer
complex state logic => useReducer
Multiple actions modifying state => useReducer
when passing state/handler deep into children => useReducer + useContext
