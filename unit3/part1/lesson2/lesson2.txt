State in React | Stateless vs Stateful Components

--- by the end of this lesson you will understand ---
1. what state is in react
2. How useState() works
3. difference between stateless and stateful components
4. why react re-renders when state changes
5. rules of react
6. updating state correctly(very important)

1. what is state => data that changes over time and affects what React shows on the screen

Example of state:-
. a counter value 
. a login status
. a toggle (dark mode on/off)
. text typed in input field
. API data(users/products)
. whether a model is open
whenever state changes, react automatically re-renders the component.

2. useState() -> the hook that creates state
you create state using
const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);

Example:-
const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue;

count -> current state value
setCount -> function to update state
0 -> initialValue

3. example => counter component

import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
    </>
  );
}

export default Counter;

--- everytime you click the button ->react updates the states ->  re-renders the component -> Updates UI ---


4. stateless vs stateful component

--- stateless component -> a component that does not hold state ---
example:-

function Heading() {
  return <h1>Hello Sunny</h1>;
}

it always return the same value
--- stateful component -> a component that has State ---

example:-
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <h1>{count}</h1>;
}

its output change based on state

5. why does state cause re-renders => because react follows a simple rule => when state changes, react re-renders the component   

example:-
setCount(count + 1);

after this, react:-
1. updates value of count
2. calls the component function again 
3. updates the JSX on screen

this is react is declarative -> you describe what the UI should look like, and react handles the rest.

6. very Important: state is asynchronous 

this will not work 
setCount(count + 1);
console.log(count); // ❌ old value, not updated yet

Reason: React batches state updates.
To reliably update based on previous state:

correct way 
setCount((prev) => prev+1);

7. initial state types => state can be
