Topic: React Installation, Environment Setup, Folder Structure, and JSX

1. what you need before starting => Node.js and npm (node package manager)

check if it is installed or not => nove -v, npm -v => if both show version number then it's good other wise download it from https://nodejs.org => it automatically install npm with it

2. setting up a react app => react app can be created in two ways

option 1 => using 'create react app' (CRA) => best for beginners simple set up

npx create-react-app my-react-app => run this in terminal
after that => cd my-react-app
npm start


Your app opens at http://localhost:3000

Option 2: Using Vite (Faster Build Tool) => Preferred for modern development — faster and lighter.

npm create vite@latest my-vite-app
✔ Select a framework: › React
✔ Select a variant: › JavaScript
cd my-vite-app
npm install
npm run dev

Opens at http://localhost:5173

3️⃣ Folder Structure (Explained)
Let’s break down a React project’s core folders/files.

| File / Folder           | Purpose                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main.jsx` / `index.js` | The **entry point** of your app. It tells React which component to render. |
| `App.jsx`               | Your main/root component. Every other component gets nested inside it.     |
| `components/`           | (You’ll create this) Folder for reusable UI parts (buttons, cards, etc.)   |
| `assets/`               | For images, icons, etc.                                                    |

📁 public/ folder

Contains static assets like index.html.
React apps render everything inside a single HTML file — that’s how SPAs work.

⚙️ package.json

Stores metadata and all your dependencies:

{
  "name": "my-react-app",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1"
  }
}
